# Physic-Game

Let's play a game!!

Try to guess what letter I'm thinking, but not so fast! You ONLY have 9 guesses and remenber there're 26 letters in the alphabet

* Every time you select a letter your guesses will decrease.
* If you guess the letter: CONGRATS. You won and you'll have to guess the new letter.
* OH! If the guesses get to zero: GAME OVER! But don't worry you can keep playing trying to guess the new letter I'm thinking. 

GOOD LUCK!!
